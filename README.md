# Cracking Caesar's Cipher

Caesar's Cipher shifts all letters by 13 characters. By converting each letter to its unicode number and changing the number, this function will "undo" Caesar's Cipher. 

This project was created as part of FreeCodeCamp's Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures certificate challenges.
